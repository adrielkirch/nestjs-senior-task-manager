Introduction:

Welcome, aspiring software architects and developers, to an illuminating journey through the realms of Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). 
In this lesson, we will delve into the core principles, methodologies, and benefits of these influential approaches, equipping you with invaluable insights and strategies to engineer robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.

    Understanding Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob:

    Clean Architecture, championed by the eminent software engineer Robert C. Martin, affectionately known as Uncle Bob, advocates for a profound restructuring of software systems, emphasizing the primacy of architecture over implementation details. At its heart lies the fundamental principle of separation of concerns, where architectural boundaries delineate distinct layers of the system, each catering to specific responsibilities and dependencies.

        Layers of Clean Architecture:
            Entities: Core business objects embodying fundamental domain concepts, encapsulating enterprise-wide rules and behaviors.
            Use Cases: Application-specific business logic and workflows, orchestrating interactions between entities and external systems.
            Interface Adapters: Bridges between the inner layers and external frameworks, handling input/output operations and data transformations.
            Frameworks and Drivers: External frameworks, tools, and platforms, constituting the outermost layer and interchangeable components.

        Key Tenets:
            Dependency Rule: Dependencies must flow inward, with high-level modules independent of low-level details, fostering flexibility and testability.
            Stable Abstractions Principle: Abstractions should be stable over time, minimizing the impact of changes and promoting architectural integrity.
            Screaming Architecture: The architecture should express the intent of the system loud and clear, with its design reflecting the core business goals and priorities.

    Embracing Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

    Domain-Driven Design, a seminal methodology introduced by Eric Evans, offers a holistic approach to software development, centered around understanding and modeling the domain of the problem being solved. 
    It advocates for collaboration between domain experts and developers, fostering a shared understanding of the domain's intricacies and nuances.

    Core Concepts:

    a. Ubiquitous Language:
    - In DDD, the Ubiquitous Language refers to a shared vocabulary between domain experts and developers. 
    This language helps bridge the communication gap by using terms and phrases that accurately represent the domain's concepts and processes. 
    By establishing a common language, stakeholders can effectively communicate requirements, reducing misunderstandings and facilitating knowledge transfer.

    b. Bounded Contexts:
    - Bounded Contexts define explicit boundaries around specific areas of the domain. 
    Within each Bounded Context, there exists a distinct model and language tailored to the domain's requirements.
    This isolation promotes clarity and cohesion by focusing on a particular aspect of the domain without being influenced by external factors. 
    Bounded Contexts enable teams to develop autonomous models that reflect the unique needs of their respective domains, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

    c. Aggregates and Entities:
    - Aggregates and Entities represent clusters of domain objects and their relationships. 
    Entities encapsulate the core business logic and state, while Aggregates define consistency boundaries within which Entities operate. 
    By grouping related Entities together, Aggregates ensure transactional integrity and enforce business rules. 
    This encapsulation promotes modularity and simplifies complex domain models, enabling developers to reason about and manage domain behavior effectively.

    d. Domain Services:
    - Domain Services encapsulate stateless operations or behaviors that do not naturally belong to any specific Entity. 
    These services represent domain logic and operations that span multiple Entities or Aggregates. 
    By extracting such behaviors into standalone services, DDD promotes a cohesive and modular architecture that adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
    Domain Services enable developers to express complex domain behavior in a clear and reusable manner, enhancing maintainability and flexibility.

    Strategic and Tactical Patterns:

    a. Strategic Design:
    - Strategic Design involves long-term planning and organization of the domain model to align with business goals and priorities. 
    This phase focuses on identifying Bounded Contexts, defining their boundaries, and establishing relationships between them. 
    Strategic Design aims to create a coherent and scalable architecture that reflects the underlying business domain's structure and dynamics. 
    By aligning the domain model with business objectives, Strategic Design ensures that the software system remains flexible and adaptable to evolving requirements.

    b. Tactical Design:
    - Tactical Design encompasses the concrete implementation of domain concepts and patterns to solve specific problems and address domain complexities. 
    This phase involves designing Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, and Domain Services based on the insights gained from Strategic Design. 
    Tactical Design focuses on optimizing domain behavior, ensuring consistency and integrity, and minimizing coupling between domain elements. 
    By applying tactical patterns such as Domain-Driven Design Patterns and Domain-Driven Development Techniques, developers can translate abstract domain concepts into practical and robust software solutions.

About folder organization

controllers:
    This directory contains the controller classes responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and generating appropriate responses.
    It is divided into subdirectories for different features or resources, such as default and user.
    Example files:
        default.controller.ts: Controller for handling default routes or actions.
        user.controller.ts: Controller for handling user-related actions.
data:
    This directory typically contains data-related interfaces or protocols.
    It is organized into subdirectories based on the type of data or data source.
    Example files:
        user-repository.interface.ts: Interface defining methods for interacting with user data in the database.
domain:
    This directory contains domain-related entities, value objects, and business logic.
    It is organized into subdirectories based on different domain concepts or aggregates.
    Example files:
        user.ts: Domain entity representing a user.
        user.spec.ts: Unit tests for the user domain entity.
infrastructure:
    This directory typically contains infrastructure-related code, such as configuration, database access, and dependency injection.
    It is organized into subdirectories based on different infrastructure concerns.
    Example files:
        configure.module.ts: Module for configuring various aspects of the application.
        mongodb-user-repository.ts: Concrete implementation of the user repository interface for MongoDB.
main:
    This directory contains configuration and entry point files for the application.
    It is organized into subdirectories for different configuration aspects or entry points.
    Example files:
        swagger-config.ts: Configuration file for Swagger documentation.
        user.transformer.ts: Transformer for converting user data between different formats.
usecases:
    This directory typically contains application-specific business logic or use cases.
    It is organized into subdirectories for different use cases or features.
    Example files:
        add-user-usecase.ts: Use case for adding a new user to the system.
        load-all-users-usecase.ts: Use case for loading all users from the database.
