 Pure referebce

    Domain-Driven Design (DDD):
        Clear domain model representing the problem space.
        Bounded contexts defining clear boundaries within the system.
        Ubiquitous language used throughout the project for consistent communication.
        Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, and Domain Events to model the domain.
        Domain Services encapsulating domain logic that doesn't naturally fit into entities or value objects.

    Test-Driven Development (TDD):
        Writing tests before writing production code.
        Unit tests covering individual components, integration tests covering interactions between components, and end-to-end tests covering entire user flows.
        Continuous integration and automated testing pipelines to ensure code quality and reliability.

    Swagger for Documentation:
        OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications for documenting APIs.
        Automatically generated API documentation from code annotations.
        Detailed descriptions of endpoints, request parameters, response payloads, and error codes.

    Dependency Injection (DI):
        Inversion of Control (IoC) container managing dependencies and their lifecycles.
        Constructor injection, property injection, or method injection for providing dependencies to classes.
        Decoupling of components, allowing for easier testing, maintenance, and scalability.

    Use Cases:
        Application services implementing high-level use cases or business operations.
        Use case classes encapsulating business logic and coordinating interactions between domain entities and infrastructure services.
        Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) adhered to, with each use case responsible for a specific task or operation.

    Interface Repository for DI in the Database:
        Repository interfaces defining contracts for interacting with the database.
        Multiple implementations of repository interfaces for different database technologies (e.g., SQL, NoSQL) or for different environments (e.g., production, testing).
        Dependency injection of repository implementations into application services or domain services.

    Cybersecurity with Multiple Roles:
        Role-based access contro defining permissions and access levels for different roles within the system.
        Authentication mechanisms such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for verifying the identity of users.
        Authorization middleware or filters enforcing access control policies based on the roles and permissions of authenticated users.
        Security best practices followed throughout the development process, including input validation, encryption, and protection against common security vulnerabilities.
        Limiter for security in HTTP requests to avoid brute force attacks.
    
    Observability:
        Logging: Implement logging mechanisms throughout the application to capture important events, errors, and information about the system's behavior. Use structured logging for easier analysis and correlation of log data.
        etrics: Define and collect metrics that provide insights into the performance and behavior of the system. Measure key indicators such as request latency, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization.
        racing: Integrate distributed tracing to track requests as they propagate through different components of the system. Trace spans provide visibility into the flow of requests and help identify performance bottlenecks and dependencies.
        onitoring: Set up monitoring tools and dashboards to visualize metrics and monitor the health of the system in real-time. Configure alerts to notify stakeholders of abnormal behavior or performance degradation.
        rror Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures and exceptions. Log errors with contextual information to facilitate troubleshooting and debugging.
        nstrumentation: Instrument code with observability libraries and frameworks to collect telemetry data. Use standard protocols such as OpenTelemetry or OpenTracing for compatibility with various observability tools and platforms.
    
    Webhooks:

        Define webhook endpoints to receive HTTP requests from external systems.
        Implement logic to handle webhook events, such as processing incoming data, triggering actions, or updating internal state.
        Ensure security measures such as authentication and authorization are in place to validate incoming webhook requests and prevent unauthorized access.
        Use webhooks for event-driven architecture, allowing the system to react to specific events or changes in real-time.
        Provide documentation for webhook endpoints, including payload formats, supported events, and error handling.
        Implement retries and error handling mechanisms for webhook delivery to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.
        Monitor webhook activity and performance to detect and address issues promptly.
        Consider scalability and performance implications when designing webhook endpoints to handle varying levels of traffic and load.
