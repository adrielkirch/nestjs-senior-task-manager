Software Requirements Specification Document

1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional requirements for a comprehensive task management application tailored for software engineering teams. The application aims to facilitate efficient task allocation, tracking, and collaboration within teams while adhering to best practices in software development, including Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Clean Architecture principles.
2. User Roles and Authentication

    Roles: The system consists of two primary roles:
        Admin: Users with administrative privileges who can manage teams, invite users, and perform various administrative tasks.
        Regular Users: Standard users who can create, manage, and track tasks within their teams.

    Authentication: Users should be able to securely register, login, and logout from the application. Authentication mechanisms should follow industry-standard security practices to ensure data integrity and user privacy.

3. Multi-Tenancy

    Description: The application is designed to support multiple independent instances (tenants), each with its own data, users, and settings.
    Admin Teams: Each admin user is associated with only one team, ensuring a clear ownership structure within the multi-tenant environment.

4. Team Management

    Team Creation: Admin users can create teams for their organization or group, defining a distinct workspace for collaboration.
    User Invitation: Admin users have the privilege to invite other users to join their team, facilitating team expansion and collaboration.
    User Removal: Admin users can remove users from their team, managing team membership effectively.
    Settings and Configurations: Admin users possess control over their team's settings and configurations, enabling customization to suit team preferences and workflows.

5. User and Team Relationship

    Many-to-Many Relationship: Users and teams have a many-to-many relationship, allowing users to belong to multiple teams and teams to have multiple associated users.
    Team Membership: Each user can belong to multiple teams, facilitating cross-team collaboration and flexibility in project assignments.

6. Task Management

    Task Creation: Users can create tasks within their team, specifying attributes such as title, description, due date, priority, and status.
    Task Assignment: Users can assign tasks to themselves or other team members, ensuring clear ownership and accountability.
    Task Tracking: Users can mark tasks as completed or reopen tasks, providing visibility into task progress and status.
    Task Editing and Deletion: Users can edit and delete tasks they created, allowing for adjustments and cleanup as needed.
    Task Viewing and Filtering: Users can view a list of tasks assigned to them and filter tasks based on different criteria such as status, priority, and due date.

7. Notification System

    Task Notifications: Users receive notifications for task assignments, updates, and reminders (e.g., approaching due dates), keeping them informed and engaged.
    Admin Notifications: Admin users may receive additional notifications related to team management activities, such as user invitations and user removals, ensuring timely awareness of team-related actions.

8. Access Control and Permissions

    Admin Privileges: Admin users have full control over their team and can perform all actions related to team management and task management, ensuring effective team leadership and governance.
    Regular User Access: Regular users have restricted access and can only perform actions related to task management within their team, maintaining data integrity and security.
    Access Control Mechanisms: Access control mechanisms should enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access data and perform actions authorized for their role and team, safeguarding data confidentiality and privacy.

9. Application Architecture

    Domain-Driven Design (DDD): The application architecture follows DDD principles, emphasizing clear domain modeling, bounded contexts, and ubiquitous language to align with the business domain and foster collaboration between domain experts and developers.
    Test-Driven Development (TDD): Development follows TDD practices, where tests are written before code implementation to ensure code correctness, reliability, and maintainability.
    Clean Architecture: The application architecture adheres to Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into distinct layers (e.g., domain, application, infrastructure) to promote modularity, scalability, and testability.

10. Conclusion

This document outlines the functional requirements for the task management application, emphasizing user roles and authentication, multi-tenancy support, team management, user-team relationships, task management, notifications, access control, and adherence to DDD, TDD, and Clean Architecture principles. These requirements serve as a foundation for the development of a robust, scalable, and user-friendly software solution tailored for software engineering teams.
